## 🟡 About Native Yield
At Blasteens, we're committed to reinvesting all native yields and transaction fees directly back into the community through leaderboard competitions and the Lotto system, emphasizing our dedication to enhancing the experience for both players and developers. Yield received from Blast will be fairly distributed between gamers and developers. For instance, the distribution for an Arcade game is as follows:
- 🥇 **30%**
- 🥈 **20%**
- 🥉 **10%**
- 4️⃣ to 🔟 **4.29%** (30% would be evenly shared with 7 gamers)
- 🧑‍💻 Developer **10%**
 
> The allocation of Independent and AAA Games will be assessed in collaboration with the game developers.

> Blast yield comes from ETH staking and RWA protocols. The yield from these decentralized protocols is passed back to Blast users automatically. The default interest rate on other L2s is 0%. On Blast, it’s 4% for ETH and 5% for stablecoins. For more information: [about Blast](https://docs.blast.io/about-blast)
